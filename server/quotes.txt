Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
- H. Abelson and G. Sussman (in "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)

The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology--the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects.
- H. Abelson and G. Sussman (in "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)

We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about languages and program design. This is the approach of statified design, the notion that a complex system should be structured as a sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages. Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are used as primitives at the next level. The language used at each level of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.

The huge printing presses of a major Chicago newspaper began malfunctioning on the Saturday before Christmas, putting all the revenue for advertising that was to appear in the Sunday paper in jeopardy. None of the technicians could track down the problem. Finally, a frantic call was made to the retired printer who had worked with these presses for over 40 years. "We'll pay anything; just come in and fix them," he was told.
When he arrived, he walked around for a few minutes, surveying the presses; then he approached one of the control panels and opened it. He removed a dime from his pocket, turned a screw 1/4 of a turn, and said, "The presses will now work correctly." After being profusely thanked, he was told to submit a bill for his work.

The bill arrived a few days later, for $10,000.00! Not wanting to pay such a huge amount for so little work, the printer was told to please itemize his charges, with the hope that he would reduce the amount once he had to identify his services. The revised bill arrived: $1.00 for turning the screw; $9,999.00 for knowing which screw to turn.

Commentary: most debugging problems are fixed easily; identifying the location of the problem is hard.

I can only think that the book is read because it deals with the difficulties of schooling, which do not change. Please note: the difficulties, not the problems. Problems are solved or disappear with the revolving times. Difficulities remain. It will always be difficult to teach well, to learn accurately; to read, write, and count readily and competently; to acquire a sense of history and start one's education or anothers.
- J. Barzun ("Begin Here", pp 14),

The American university is built on two false premises: that all teachers must add to the existing stock of knowledge by research, and that all self-respecting institutions fulfill this role only by employing productive scholars...Of course, the teacher must keep reading and thinking abreast of his time, but this does not mean that he must write and publish. The confusion hides a further absurd assumption, which is that when a man writes a scholarly book that reaches a dozen specialists he adds immeasurably to the world's knowledge; whereas if he imparts his thoughts and his reading to one hundred and fifty students every year, he is wasting his time and leaving the world in darkness. One is tempted to ask what blinkered pedant ever launched the notion that students in coming to college seceded from the human race and may therefore be safely left out when knowledge is being broadcast.
- J. Barzun ("Teacher in America"),

The sole justification of teaching, of the school itself, is that the student comes out of it able to do something he could not do before. I say do and not know, because knowledge that doesn't lead to doing something new or doing something better is not knowledge at all.

Software development has been, is, and will likely remain fundamentally hard. Building quality systems involves an essential and irreducible complexity, which is why the entire history of software engineering can be characterized as one of rising levels of abstraction. As such, the task of the software development team is to engineer the illusion of simplicity. Nonetheless, software-intensive systems can amplify human intelligence, but they cannot replace human judgment; software-intensive systems can fuse, co-ordinate, classify, and analyze information, but they cannot create knowledge. In other words, not everything we want to build can be built: there exist pragmatic theoretical and technical limits that make software develpment hard if not impossible. Furthermore, not everything we want to build should be built: there exist moral economic, social, and political limits that govern human industry. From fundamental to human, these are the factors tht define the limits of software, factors that separate our vision from execution.

The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be. ... The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.

In a way, math isn't the art of answering mathematical questions, it is the art of asking the right questions, the questions that give you insight, the ones that lead you in interesting directions, the ones that connect with lots of other interesting questions -the ones with beautiful answers.
- G. Chaitin (pg. 23, in "Meta Math: The Quest for Omega")

Mathematical truth is not totally objective. If a mathematical statement is false, there will be no proofs, but if it is true, thre will be an endless variety of proofs, not just one! Proofs are not impersonal, they express the personality of their creator/discoverer just as much as literary efforts do. If something important is true, there will be many reasons that it is true, many proofs of that fact. Math is the music of reason, and some proofs sound like jazz, others sound like a fugue. Which is better, the jazz or the fugue? Neither: it's all a matter of taste...each proof will emphasize different aspects of the problem, each proof will lead in a different direction. Each one will have different corollaries, different generalizations...Mathematical facts are not isolated, they are woven into a vast spider's web of interconnections.

When the words are fuzzy, the programmers reflexively retreat to the most precise method of articulation available: source code.

So the situation frequently crops up where nomenclature confusion drives programmers to begin coding prematurely, and that code becomes the de facto design, regardless of its appropriateness or correctness.

As long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now [1972] that we have gigantic computers, programming has become a gigantic problem. As the power of available machines grew by a factor of more than a thousand, society's ambition to apply these new machines grew in proportion, and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this exploded field of tension between the ends and the means. The increased power of the hardware, together with the perhaps more dramatic increase in its reliability, made solutions feasible that the programmer had not dared to dream about a few years before. And now, a few years later, he had to dream about them and even worse, he had to transform such dreams into reality! It is no wonder that we found ourselves in a software crisis

Yes, I share your concern: how to program well -though a teachable topic- is hardly taught. The situation is similar to that in mathematics, where the explicit curriculum is confined to mathematical results; how to do mathematics is something the student must absorb by osmosis, so to speak. One reason for preferring symbol-manipulating, calculating arguments is that their design is much better teachable than the design of verbal/pictorial arguments. Large-scale introduction of courses on such calculational methodology, however, would encounter unsurmoutable political problems.

In those days [batch processing] programmers never even documented their programs, because it was assumed that nobody else would ever use them. Now, however, time-sharing had made exchanging software trivial: you just stored one copy in the public repository and therby effectively gave it to the world. Immediately people began to document their programs and to think of them as being usable by others. They started to build on each other's work.
- R. Fano (in Waldrop, "The Dream Machine", pp. 232)

Thus, writing a clever piece of code that works is one thing; designing something that can support a long-lasting business is quite another. Commercial software design and production is, or should be, a rigorous, capital-intensive activity. Software products should be based on a broad, deep structure that can support much more than whatever the product contains at any given time. In addition to code that works, you need documentation, help functions, error handling, multi-platform support, and multiple languages. You also need an underlying architecture that allows you to add and change features, purchase and integrated external software components, and allows other software vendors to make their products talk to yours, add customized widgets to it, embed your product inside something larger of their own. A good architecture, one that will carry you for a decade's worth of unpredictable technology and marked changes, take months to develop. But if you skip this step, as Netscape did, you have made a truly Faustian bargain.
The problem with this [building just what you need, instead of planning ahead] is that these systems start getting ferociously complicated. It comes time to fix a mistake, add a feature, replace something and you discover that everything is connected to everything else in ways you can't even begin to understand. Because you're doing something more ambitious than the initial academic prototype, it's big enough that you need to partition it across a team. The members of the team need to have a clear idea of how their work relates to everyone else's, and they need to be able to communicate to the testers whose job it is to find errors. Otherwise [in other words], you give the patient a kidney transplant and his heart suddenly fails; then you give him a heart drug, but that makes his lungs collapse. You don't know why, and you're screwed.

And then the future comes, and you're really screwed. Later releases of the product inevitably are more complex, because they must continue to support previous version while adding new capabilities. You discover that the original developers have quit or been promoted or have forgotten what they did, and it's time to keep up with the competition by adding new features, supporting more platforms, translating into Japanese, and so forth. The engineering team has to quadruple in size. You start discovering things like three different groups need to change the same piece of code, and each set of changes causes problems for the others, and nobody else can test their work until that piece of code is stable, so a hundred people twiddle their thumbs for a week. Or you want to use an existing function for some new purpose, but you can't isolate it from everything else, so you have to write it all over again. This not only means that you have the extra time and cost of writing and maintaining twice as much code, but you probably have to ensure that the two versions work exactly alike, which they almost certainly won't.

With each successive release, these problems get worse. By the time you're on your fifth release, the decision to do your first product the quick and dirty way has probably cost you ten times what it originally saved. A program like Microsoft's Windows 98 is tens of millions of lines of code. Nobody can keep that much complexity in their head or hope to manage it effectively. So you need an architecture that says to everyone, "Here's how this thing works, and to do your part, you need to understand only these five things, and don't you dare touch anything else."

I can live with doubt and uncertainty. I think it's much more intersting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong... In physics the truth is rarely perfectly clear, and that is certainly universally the case in human affairs. Hence, what is not surrounded by uncertaintly cannot be the truth.
- R. Feynman (in "Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track: The Letters of Richard P. Feynman")

If you're teaching a class, you can think about the elementary things that you know very well. These things are kind of fun and delightful. It doesn't do any harm to think them over again. Is there a better way to present them? The elementary things are easy to think about; if you can't think of a new thought, no harm done; what you thought about it before is good enough for the class. If you do think of something new, you're rather pleased that you have a new way of looking at it.
The questions of the students are often the source of new research. They often ask profound questions that I've thought about at times and then given up on, so to speak, for a while. It wouldn't do me any harm to think about them again and see if I can go any further now. The students may not be able to see the thing I want to answer, or the subtleties I want to think about, but they remind me of a problem by asking questions in the neighborhood of that problem. It's not so easy to remind yourself of these things.

Habitability is the characteristic of source code that enables programmers coming to the code later in its life to understand its construction and intentions and to change it comfortably and confidently... Software needs to be habitable because it always has to change...Programs are written and maintained, bugs are fixed, features are added, performance is tuned, and a whole variety of changes are made both by the original and new programming team members... What is important is that it be easy for programmers to come up to speed with the code, to be able to navigate through it effectively, to be able to understand what changes to make, and to be able to make them safely and correctly.

Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity. ...

A really good language should be both clean and dirty: cleanly designed, with a small core of well understood and highly orthogonal operators, but dirty in the sense that it lets hackers have their way with it....A real hacker's language will always have a slightly raffish character.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 204)

Fixing fresh bugs is easier than fixing old ones. It's usaully fairly quick to find a bug in code you just wrote. When it turns up you often know what's wrong before you even look at the source, because you were already worrying about it subconsciously. Fixing a bug in something you wrote six months aga (the average case if you release once a year) is a lot more work. And since you don't understand the code as well, you're more likely to fix it in an ugly way, or even introduce more bugs.
When you catch bugs early, you also get fewer compound bugs. Compound bugs are two separate bugs that interact: you trip going downstairs, and when you reach for the handrail it come off in your hand. In software this kind of bug is the hardest to find, and also tends to have the worst consequences. The traditional "break everything and then filter out the bugs" approach inherently yields a lot of compound bugs. And software released in a series of small chances inherently tends not to. The floors are constantly being swept clean of any loose objects that might later get stuck to something.

- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 65-66)

Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts that no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. When it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 29)

Imagine the kind of conversation you would have with someone so far away that there was a transmission delay of one minute. Now imagine speaking to someone in the next room. You wouldn't just have the same conversation faster, you would have a different kind of conversation. In Lisp, developing software is like speaking face-to-face. You can test code as you're writing it. And instant turnaround has just as dramatic an effect on development as it does on conversation. You don't just write the same program faster; you write a different kind of program.
- P. Graham (in "On Lisp")

The difference between design and research seems to be a question of the good versus the new. Design doesn't have to be new, but it has to be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to be new. I think these two paths converge at the top: the best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the best research solves problems that are not only new, but worth solving. So ultimately design and research are aiming for the same destination, just approaching it from different directions.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" footnote 9, pg. 224)

The way to make programs easy to read is not to stuff them with comments... A good programming language ought to be better for explaining software than English. You should only need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn readers about, just as on a road there are only arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" footnote 9, pg. 224)

You should figure our programs as you're writing them, just as writers and painters and achitects do. Realizing this [programming as sketching] has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen.

Remember too that languages are not primarily a form for finished programs, but something that programs have to be developed into.

A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it easy to change your mind.

Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings, when you look at them in x-rays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.

So the test of a language is not simply how clean the finished program looks in it, but how clean the path to the finished program was.

What made oil paint so exciting, when it first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that you could make the finished work from the prototype. You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to, but you weren't held to it; you could work out all the details, and even make major changes as you finished the painting. You can do this with software too. A prototype doesn't have to be just a model; you can refine it into the finished product....it's good for morale.

Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged. In software, my rule is: always have working code. If you're writing something you'll be able to test in an hour, you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you.
- P. Graham (in "Hackers and Painters" pg. 22, 27, 218, 219, 220, 221)

Incidentally, when we're faced with a "prove or disprove," we're usually better off trying first to disprove with a counterexample, for two reasons: A disproof is potentially easier (we need just one counterexample); and nitpicking arouses our creative juices. Even if the given assertion is true, our search for a counterexample often leads to a proof, as soon as we see why a counterexample is impossible. Besides, it's healthy to be skeptical.

It is very interesting to me how quickly the class has divided up into three factions. One faction being the students who sit in the back of the class, given up sitting in their assigned seats, preparing the cases. What is it, only October? They've already given up trying -the cowards. The second group are the ones who won't raise their hands or volunteer an answer, but will try when they're called upon. That's where I am right now, living in a state of constant fear. And then there's the third echelon: the upper echelon; the volunteers. They raise their hands in class. They thrust themselves into the fray. I don't think they're smarter than anyone else, but they have courage. And, they'll achieve the final recognition, that teachers will get to know their names, and they'll get better grades. The past couple weeks I've been preparing to enter the upper echelon, and this weekend -if I can get all my work done- I'm going to enter it Monday morning, in Kingsfield's contract law class.

[Breaking into the "red" room in the Harvard law library, which contains the notes of Harvard professors from their school days, and drafts of their articles and books] Do you realize what this is?

"Kingsfield, Charles W. notes on contract lawy in the course on contracts by Professor Williston at the Harvard Law School, 1927". What the hell is it. They're just notes: and they look just like mine. Look [reading from Kingsfield's notes]. "Questions: Does everybody have a contract to obey everybody else's rights. What is a contract? What do you owe to others?" Look, there are even doodles. [C'mon, let's get outta here.] Wait, wait. "Can we make a contract with G-d that is biding to man? ... After all, I am almost the living extension of the old judges. Where would they be without me. I carry in my mind the cases they wrote. Where the hell woudl they be if it wasn't for me? Who would hang their pictures if there were no law students? It's hard being the living extension of tradition."

It's [programming] the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation.

...At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but I soon realized it was doomed to success. Almost anything in software can be implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination. There is nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a hundred million dollars. But there is one quality that cannot be purchased in this way -and that is reliability. The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay.

What is the central core of the subject [computer science]? What is it that distinguishes it from the separate subjects with which it is related? What is the linking thread which gathers these disparate branches into a single discipline. My answer to these questions is simple -it is the art of programming a computer. It is the art of designing efficient and elegant methods of getting a computer to solve problems, theoretical or practical, small or large, simple or complex. It is the art of translating this design into an effective and accurate computer program.

Using a language we may create models of phenomena of interest, and by using models, phenomena may be studied for purposes of understanding or prediction. Models may be used for analysis focussed on a close examination of individual parts of the model and for synthesis aimed at understanding the interplay of the parts, that is, understanding the model as a whole. A novel is like a model of the real world expressed in a written languagee like English. In a novel, the characters may be analyzed and the interaction between people may be displayed and studied.

To treat programming scientifically, it must be possible to specify the required properties of programs precisely. Formality is certainly not an end in itself.

That simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. What we meant by that was when you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple with all these simple solutions, you don't really understand the complexity of the problem. And your solutions are way too oversimplified, and they don't work. Then you get into the problem, and you see it's really complicated. And you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That's sort of the middle, and that's where most people stop, and the solutions tend to work for a while. But the really great person will keep on going and find, sort of, the key, underlying principle of the problem. And come up with a beautiful elegant solution that works.

We don't manage our time as well as we manage our space. There's an overhead of starting and an overhead of stopping a project because you kind of lose your momentum. And you've got to bracket and put aside all the things you're already doing. So you need reasonably large blocks of uninterrupted time if you're going to be successful at doing some of these things. That's why hackers tend to stay up late.
If you stay up late and you have another hour of work to do, you can just stay up another hour later without running into a wall and having to stop. Whereas it might take three or four hours if you start over, you might finish if you just work that extra hour. If you're a morning person, the day always intrudes a fixed amount of time in the future. So it's much less efficient. Which is why I think computer people tend to be night people -because a machine doesn't get sleepy.

If you have a large number of unrelated ideas, you have to get quite a distance away from them to get a view of all of them, and this is the role of abstraction.

Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you are as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
- B. Kernighan

Another effective [debugging] technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed "Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you." This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before they could speak to a human counselor.

The study of law is something new and unfamiliar to most of you -unlike any schooling you have ever been through before. We use the Socratic method here: I call on you, ask you a question, and you answer it. Why don't I just give you a lecture? Because through my questions you learn to teach yourselves. Through this method of questioning-answering, questioning-answering, we seek to develop in you the ability to analyze that vast complex of facts that constitute the relationships of members within a given society. Questioning and answering. At times, you may feel that you have found the correct answer. I assure you that this is a total delusion on your part. You will never find the correct, absolute, and final answer. In my classroom, there is always another question, another question to follow your answer. Yes, you are on a treadmill. My little questions spin the tumblers of your mind. You are on an operating table; my little questions are the fingers probing your brain. We do brain surgery here. You teach yourselves the law, but I train your mind. You come in here with a skull full of mush, and you leave thinking like a lawyer.

Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.
- D. Knuth (Tex, pg. 9)

Debugging is an art that needs much further study .... The most effective debugging techniques seem to be those which are designed and built into the program itself -many of today's best programmers will devote nearly half of their programs to facilitating the debugging process on the other half; the first half... will eventually be thrown away, but the net result is a surprising gain in productivity.
Another good debugging practice is to keep a record of every mistake that is made. Even though this will probably be quite embarrassing, such information is invaluable to anyone doing research on the debugging problem, and it will also help you learn how to reduce the number of future errors.

- D. Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1)

...methods are more important than facts. The educational value of a problem given to a student depends mostly on how often the thought processes that are invoked to solve it will be helpful in later situations. It has little to do with how useful the answer to the problem may be. On the other hand, a good problem must also motivate the students; they should be interested in seeing the answer. Since students differ so greatly, I cannot expect everyone to like the problems that please me.

...One of the most important lessons, perhaps, is the fact that SOFTWARE IS HARD. From now on I shall have significantly greater respect for every successful software tool that I encounter. During the past decade I was surprised to learn that the writing of programs for TeX and Metafont proved to be much more difficult than all the other things I had done (like proving theorems or writing books). The creation of good software demand a significiantly higher standard of accuracy than those other things do, and it requires a longer attention span than other intellectual tasks.
- D. Knuth (in "Selected Papers on Computer Science", pp 161)

We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
- D. Knuth

When I speak about computer programming as an art, I am thinking primarily of it as an art form, in an aesthetic sense. The chief goal of my work as an educator and author is to help people learn how to write beautiful programs...My feeling is that when we prepare a program, the experience can be just like composing poetry or music...Some programs are elegant, some are exquisite, some are sparkling. My claim is that it is possible to write grand programs, noble programs, truly magnificent ones!...computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity, and especially because it produces objects of beauty. Programmers who subconsciously view themselves as artists will enjoy what they do and will do it better.
- D. Knuth (Computer Programming as an Art. Turing Award Speech 1974)

When certain concepts of TeX are introduced informally, general rules will be stated; afterwards you will find that the rules aren't strictly true. In general, the later chapters contain more reliable information than the earlier ones do. The author feels that this technique of deliberate lying will actually make it easier for you to learn the ideas. Once you understand a simple but false rule, it will not be hard to supplement that rule with its exceptions.

If we really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem.

There is a race between the increasing complexity of the systems we build and our ability to develop intellectual tools for understanding their complexity. If the race is won by our tools, then systems will eventually become easier to use and more reliable. If not, they will continue to become harder to use and less reliable for all but a relatively small set of common tasks. Given how hard thinking is, if those intellectual tools are to succeed, they will have to substitute calculation for thought.

"Where have you performed?" Murray asked me from behind a copy of Variety. "Well, I don't perform, exactly," I answered, "but I have spoken at synagogues, and I lecture from time to time at colleges and universities."
"Universities?" Murray sputtered. "Did he say universities? Worst audience in the world. I spoke at a university once. They invited me to speak about the hotel industry. Believe me, I've got a pretty good routine on this; I've used it many times before, and I know where I'm supposed to get reactions: chuckles, laughs, applause. Son of a bitch, I stand up there and it's a grim audience! All these young people in jeans and sneakers. I open it up for questions. These bastards are dead serious -they're taking notes! I realized later, they weren't an audience, they were students. They take notes and get grades. They're not there to laugh. Who wants to perform for an audience like that?"

- A. Lansky, relating his experiences lecturing at resorts in the Catskills while raising money for the National Yiddish Book Center (described in his book, "Outwitting History")

We think only through the medium of words. Languages are true analytical methods. Algebra, which is adapted to its purpose in every species of expression, in the most simple, most exact, and best manner possible, is at the same time a language and an analytical method. The art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well arranged.

A vivid confirmation of this analysis [the importance of extra-curricular activities] occurred during a lunchtime conversation I had with three computer science graduates of the classes of 1994/1995 who started a company together and sold it in 1998 for more than $250 million. Over sandwiches I asked them what part of their computer science education had been most important to the success of their software enterprise. After a moment of tight smiles and awkward silence, one of the young graduates spoke up. "The computer science courses I took were really terrific," he said in an attempt to reassure me, "but I didn't learn much that I could not have learned on my own. The most important things I learned were from managing the Quincy House Grill." It made perfect sense -hiring, firing, and inspiring colleagues, working under pressure in close quarters- all were very much the same in the cheeseburger-flipping business he had run at Harvard as in the software business the three had started in a tiny apartment.
- H. Lewis (in "Excellence Without Soul", pg. 88)

...fielding statistics made sense only as numbers, not as language. Language, not numbers, is what interested him [Bill James, a baseball writer]. Words, and the meaning they were designed to convey. "When the numbers acquire the significance of the language," he later wrote, "they acquire the power to do all the things which language can do: to become fiction and drama and poetry."

Composing computer programs to solve scientific problems is like writing poetry. You must choose every word with care and link it with the other words in perfect syntax. There is no place for verbosity or carelessness. To become fluent in a computer lnaguage demands almost the antithesis of modern loose thinking. It requires many interactive sessions, the hands-on use of the device. You do not learn a foreign language from a book, rather you have to live in the country for year to let the langauge become an automatic part of you, and the same is true for computer languages.

Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don't improve it. Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like try to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don't buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, don't test more; develop better.

Formal methods will never have a significant impact until they can be used by people who don't understand them.

Programming is similar to a game of golf. The point is not getting the ball in the hole but how many strokes it takes.
- H. Mills

The only way for errors to occur in a program is by being put there by the author. No other mechanisms are known. Programs can't acquire bugs by sitting around with other buggy programs. Right practice aims at preventing insertion of errors and, failing that, removing them before testing or any other running of the program.

Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that's creativity.

A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren't flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.
- M. Minsky (in "Why Programming Is a Good Medium for Expressing Poorly-Understood and Sloppily-Formulated Ideas")

Between 1892 say, and 1904, movies were made by the cameraman because he understood the equipment. And that is exactly where we are now [in software design]. In 1904 they invented the director; what was the director? It was the guy who didn't have to know how to load the camera didn't have to know how to sew costumes, play a violin, dance, fence, or hang the lights. But, he had to know how to make those effects come together in a unified experience... Why are video games so much better designed than office software? Videogames are designed by people who love to play video games. Office software is designed by people who want to do something else on the weekend... What does showbusiness teach you. It teaches you that design is war; it is a power struggle between the producers, directors, authors, everyone who wants to be involved.
- T. Nelson (transcribed from a talk at Engelbart's Unfinished Revolution a Stanford University Symposium)

In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.
- J. von Neumann

Millions for compilers, but hardly a penny for understanding human programming language use. Now, programming languages are obviously symmetrical, the computer on one side, the human on the other. In an appropriate science of computer languages, one would expect that half the effort would be on the computer side, understanding how to translate the languages into executable form, and half on the human side, understanding how to design languages that are easy or productive to use. Yet, we do not even have an enumeration of all the psychologicial functions programing languages serve for the user. Of course, there is lots of programming language design, but it comes from computer scientists. And though technical papers on languages contain main appeals to ease of use and learning, they patently contain almost no psychologicial evidence nor any appeal to psychological science.

My basic idea is that programming is the most powerful medium of developing the sophisticated and rigorous thinking needed for mathematics, for grammar, for physics, for statistics, for all the "hard" subjects....

The discipline of programming is most like sorcery. Both use precise language to instruct inanimate objects to do our bidding. Small mistakes in programs or spells can lead to completely unforseen behavior: e.g., see the story, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice".

Maguire.

The purpose of brakes on a car is to allow you to go fast. Although the gas pedal makes you go fast, the brake pedal allows you to drive safely while going fast. The purpose of a strict compiler (one that performs type checking, uninitialized variable checking, reachability analysis, etc.) is to allow you to program fast. Programmers -like all humans- have limited intellects: when they focus on one aspect of a program, they must ignore others. Focusing on the right aspect at the right time is critical. By understanding those aspects that the compiler can check, you can ignore them, and focus on more important ones. Some programmers think that such an approach is reckless; they believe that you must pay close attention to everything at once. They are right -for them; but I'm just not that smart, so I must use my tools more effectively.

There is a famous rule in performance optimization called the 90/10 rule: 90% of a program's execution time is spent in only 10% of its code. The standard inference from this rule is that programmers should find that 10% of the code and optimize it, because that's the only code where improvements make a difference in the overall system performance. But a second inference is just as important: programmers can deoptimize the other 90% of the code (in order to make it easier to use, maintain, etc.), because deterioration (of performance) of that code won't make much of a difference in the overall system performance.
- R. Pattis

When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code.

When building a complex system, having crackerjack programmers (who can make any design work, even a bad one) can be a liability. The result, after lots of effort, is a working system that cannot be easily maintained or upgraded. Good -but not great- programmers would fail early, causing a realization that the system must be redesigned, and then reimplemented. The extra cost is paid once, early in the system's cycle (when it is cheap), instead of repeatedly paid late in the system's cycle (when it is more expensive).

I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun.

Knowledge of a subject means knowledge of the language of that subject, which includes not only what its words mean, but far more important, how its words mean. As one learns the language of a subject, one is also learning what the subject is. It cannot be said often enough that what we call a subject consists mostly, if not entirely, of its language. If you eliminate all the words of a subject, you have eliminated the subject. Biology is not plants and animals. It is language about plants and animals. History is not events. It is language describing and interpreting events. Astronomy is not planets and stars. It is a way of talking about planets and stars.

Gates has always understood Moore's Law better than anyone else in the industry. If you can make something run at all, get it out there -it may be slow and clunky, but hardware improvements will bail you out.

Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones, because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity.

- R. Schank (in "The Connosseur's Guide to the Mind")

There is one very good reason to learn programming, but it has nothing to do with preparing for high-tech careers or with making sure one is computer literate in order to avoid being cynically manipulated by the computers of the future. The real value of learning to program can only be understood if we look at learning to program as an exercise of the intellect, as a kind of modern-day Latin that we learn to sharpen our minds.

Machines are simple: a hammer, a door hinge, a steak knife. Systems are much more complicated; they have components, feedback loops, mean times between failure, infrastructure. Digital systems are daedal; even a simple computer program has hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code doing all sorts of different things. A complex computer program has thousands of components, each of which has to work by itself and in interaction with all the other components. This is why object-oriented programming was developed: to deal with the complexity of digital systems...systems have bugs. A bug is a particular kind of failure...It's different from a malfunction. When something malfunctions, it no longer works properly. When something has a bug, it misbehaves in a particular way, possibly unrepeatable, and possibly unexplainable. Bugs are unique to systems. Machines can break, or fail, or not work, but only a system can have a bug.
- B. Schneier (in Secrets & Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World).

Microsoft knows that reliable software is not cost effective. According to studies, 90% to 95% of all bugs are harmless. They're never discovered by users, and they don't affect performance. It's much cheaper to release buggy software and fix the 5% to 10% of bugs people find and complain about.

A programming language is a system of notation for describing computations. A useful programming language must therefore be suited for both description(i.e., for human writers and readers of programs) and for computation (i.e., for efficient implementation on computers).

- S. Ulam (Bull. of American Mathematical Society, May 1958)

It's easy to cry "bug" when the truth is that you've got a complex system and sometimes it takes a while to get all the components to co-exist peacefully.

By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race.
- A. N. Whitehead

It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all the copybooks, and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle -they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.
- A. N. Whitehead (in "An Introduction to Mathematics")

The computer programmer ... is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver ... universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs. Moreover ... systems so formulated and elaborated act out their programmed scripts. They compliantly obey their laws and vividly exhibit their obedient behavior. No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or a field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.
- J. Weizenbaum (Computer Power and Human Reason, page 115)

Newton was a genius, but not because of the superior computational power of his brain. Newton's genius was, on the contrary, his ability to simplify, idealize, and streamline the world so that it became, in some measure, tractable to the brains of perfectly ordinary men.
- G. M. Weinberg

I have never learned anything except from people younger than myself.
- O. Wilde

As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.

Complexity has and will maintain a strong fascination for many people. It is true that we live in a complex world and strive to solve inherently complex problems, which often do require complex mechanisms. However, this should not diminish our desire for elegant solutions, which convince by their clarity and effectiveness. Simple, elegant solutions are more effective, but they are harder to find than complex ones, and they require more time, which we too often believe to be unaffordable
- N. Wirth

Increasingly, people seem to misinterpret complexity as sophistication, which is baffling -the incomprehensible should cause suspicion rather than admiration. Possibly this trend results from a mistaken belief that using a somewhat mysterious device confers an aura of power on the user.
- N. Wirth

Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster. (Or, sometimes known by] Grove [the head of Intel] giveth and Gates [the head of Microsoft] taketh away.)

More bugs have been introduced into programs through premature optimization than any other cause, including pure stupidity. (sometimes quoted as, "More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason -including blind stupidity.")

Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.
- W.B. Yeats (See Plutarch: The mind...)

Cutler, armed with a schedule [for finishing MS Windows NT], was urging the tream to "eat its own dog food." Part macho stunt and part common sense, the "dog food diet" was the cornerstone of Cutler's philosophy. "We're going to run on the program we build," he insisted. Eating dog food meant there would be no escape from facing the flaws and imperfections of NT. Even while immersed in his own piece of NT, a code writer would confront all of its weaknesses. By controlling the operations of a code writer's computer, NT would define the quality of his life. If at first NT tasted no better than dog food, all the better. Code writers would feel an urgent need to raise the dietary level by quickly fixing the errant code and writing more durable code in the first place.

 The human hearing range spans 20Hz to 20kHz. (Christopher Montgomery)

 "[W]e can use low rate 44.1kHz or 48kHz audio with all the fidelity benefits of 192kHz or higher sampling (smooth frequency response, low aliasing) and none of the drawbacks (ultrasonics that cause intermodulation distortion, wasted space). Nearly all of today's analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) oversample at very high rates." (Christopher Montgomery)

 "[T]here are (and always will be) reasons to use more than 16 bits in recording and production. None of that is relevant to playback; here 24 bit audio is as useless as 192kHz sampling. The good news is that at least 24 bit depth doesn't harm fidelity. It just doesn't help, and also wastes space." (Christopher Montgomery)

 "16 bits is enough to span the real hearing range with room to spare. It does not span the entire possible signal range of audio equipment." (Christopher Montgomery)

 "Music is no longer an expression of the soul or the work of an artist; it's a 'product' that is manufactured, packaged, catalogued, distributed, managed, regulated, and above all *sold*." (Christopher Montgomery)

 By November 1992, there were 26 websites in the world, and the web's domain was mainly academia and large industrial research institutions.

 The Mosaic browser was released in 1993, developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). It included buttons like "Home", "Back" and "Forward", as well as bookmark features and image rendering (GIF or HDF). Marc Andreessen was part of the developing team.

 Mosaic and derived browsers drove the explosive growth of the Web to over 10,000 sites by 1995 and millions by 1998.

 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina left the Mosaic team in 1994 to found Netscape, releasing the new browser Netscape Navigator, with its internal code name "Mozilla". The name was either a blending of "Mosaic" and "Godzilla" or short for "Mosaic Killer".

 Netscape called itself `Mozilla/1.0` in the user-agent string, and it came with new features such as frame support. Website developers invented browser sniffing and sent frames to Netscape and no frames to other browsers.

 When Microsoft launched Internet Explorer, which supported frames as well, they made the browser impersonate Netscape as `Mozilla/1.22 (compatible; MSIE 2.0)` so that it received frames as well.

 In the first "browser war", Internet Explorer defeated Netscape.

 Netscape was reborn as Mozilla, later Firefox, with its Gecko rendering engine. Again due to browser sniffing by website developers, other browsers started adding "Gecko" to their user-agent string.

 "Google built Chrome, and Chrome used Webkit, and it was like Safari, [...] and WebKit pretended to be KHTML, and KHTML pretended to be Gecko, and all browsers pretended to be Mozilla, [...] and the user agent string was a complete mess, and near useless, and everyone pretended to be everyone else." (Aaron Andersen)

 Never talk to potential acquirers of your company just for the sake of checking whether you'll receive an offer to good to refuse.

 When receiving offers from potential acquirers, expect a reasonable valuation. Should they ever be surprising, they'll always be surprisingly low.

 When you receive an offer for a potential acquisition, let the acquirer make the effort, which they will certainly do in case they're really serious.

 A good salesman is never the one to come up with a price first. Try to be the one reacting to the price, not the one proposing it.

 If you're in talks about selling your company and you must come up with a valuation, put it out confidently and high enough for bargaining.

 Get a good lawyer.

 Get a good accountant.

 As the buyer of a company, you'll usually prefer an asset sale, whereas as a seller, you'll probably want a stock sale.

 Sole proprietorships or partnerships cannot be sold as a stock sale, as there is no stock available.

 When selling a company, always keep your business running and growing until it's really not your job anymore.

 "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works." (John Gall)

 Advertising is like the flu. If it's not constantly changing, people develop immunity.

 "Sizing the market for a disruptor based on an incumbent's market is like sizing the car industry off how many horses there were in 1910." (Aaron Levie)

 Don't compare your company to a family -- it's not a lifetime relationship and layoffs are part of the game. You shouldn't (and can't) trust in loyalty blindly.

 Consider your company a professional sports teams: You have a mission and come together with other people to accomplish that mission. The composition of your team changes over time, but your solidarity is based on trust and mutual investment, which results in mutual benefit. All of you have to prioritize team success over individual glory and yet this is the best way to achieve individual success as well. You are going to bring together a disparate team and achieve a common goal -- despite the reality of personnel turnover. That's what all businesses should strive for. (Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, Chris Yeh)

 The main driver of inequality is returns on capital that exceed the rate of economic growth. (Thomas Piketty)

 "Design depends largely on constraints. [O]ne of the few effective keys to the design problem [is] the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible — his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints." (Charles Eames)

 Project management triangle: Fast, cheap, and reliable — choose two. That's all you can get.

 Incentivizing the right behaviors is incredibly important. Rewarding managers with bonuses if their features are part of a final product, for example, can lead to feature bloat. Don't do that.

 "[W]hile manipulating people with incentives seems to work in the short run, it is a strategy that ultimately fails and even does lasting harm. [We should] question our reliance on a theory of motivation derived from laboratory animals." (Alfie Kohn)

 "[T]he more we use artificial inducements to motivate people, the more they lose interest in what we're bribing them to do." (Alfie Kohn)

 "Start with focusing on a small market and dominate that market first." (Peter Thiel)

 "If you don't want to split shares evenly then perhaps you should not be co-founders." (Peter Thiel)

 "I am [...] a fan of the two-person founding team, with one more on the business side and one more on the technical side." (Peter Thiel)

 "We know well [Alibaba hasn't] survived because our strategies are farsighted and brilliant, or because our execution is perfect, but because for 15 years we have persevered in our mission of 'making it easier to do business across the world', because we have insisted on a 'customer first' value system, because we have persisted in believing in the future, and because we have insisted that normal people can do extraordinary things." (Jack Ma)

 The only way to fight knowledge-hiding in the workplace? "Put in incentives to reward people on team outcomes versus solely on individual outcomes." (David Zweig)

 "First-time founders care most about their exit. Every time after that, you focus on legacy." (Unknown)

 "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." (Peter Drucker)

 "Saying yes is so much easier than saying no, but nobody else will ever value your time as much as you do so you need to be a responsible steward of it." (Andrew Bosworth)

 "Look back on your past week and assemble an honest accounting of your attention. Does the time you spent in each area mirror the importance of that area? This exercise is the true test of your ability to prioritize. It will tell you whether you are able to maintain focus on the important or whether you get distracted by the urgent." (Andrew Bosworth)

 In 2014, social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) had already become a mature market with little innovation. Private messaging (e.g. WhatsApp, Snapchat) was the new social media.

 The "sharing economy" turned out to be the "rental economy", actually.

 "If you don't have first hand experience of an industry, you're probably wrong about how it works, what problems they have and so how they should be solved. Talk to people." (Ben Dixon)

 "Trying to raise money and apply to accelerators is a full time job. You're probably either building [a product] or fund raising. Not both. If in doubt, choose building." (Ben Dixon)

 Providing free returns to customers in e-commerce has proved profitable. Customers who make use of a free return are far more likely to buy again in the same shop the next time. This easily compensates for the costs of the free return.

 "[P]art of the problem with freemium is that it changes your perception of where the value lies. The user discounts the value of the free component to nothing and only measures the value of the additional functionality that is unlocked with buying the premium portion. A lot of the time, this looks like a ripoff." (scriptman)

 It's easier to lower the price when you don't sell enough than to raise the price on something that is selling well.

 "[A]s far as equity is concerned, it's worth $0 until you exit. There's a potential for millions, but my lottery ticket is also worth potentially millions of dollars. My landlord won't accept my lottery ticket as payment." (Jemaclus)

 "So one way to insider trade is, you work at a bank, and you advise on mergers, and before a merger happens you meet a guy and write the name of the target on a napkin, and the guy reads the napkin, and then he eats it, and then he buys stock in the target, and he makes money, and then you meet in a parking lot and he hands you a bag of cash representing your cut of his profits. There are a lot of variations, many involving golf, but that's the basic structure." (Matt Levine)

 "I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one." (George R. R. Martin)

 Show confidence, professionalism and competence in your response to the salary question.

 Do not lie in response to the salary question. Do not invent any high salary. Be honest and only *withhold* information.

 Perhaps suggest to get back to the salary question later on, after you've both made sure you're a good fit for each other. If you're the right fit, you'll probably be able to agree on the numbers regarding salary, vacation days and so on. Otherwise, you don't need to worry about the numbers, anyway. They are irrelevant.

 The later in the process you talk about the salary, the better. They will offer and accept higher salaries *after* learning about your skill level, as opposed to the time *before*. Otherwise, you might not even get a chance anymore to demonstrate your strengths.

 If you actually give a number as a response to the salary question, this will immediately cap your range for the negotiation. That means you'll lose out on any higher salary that they might have been willing to offer. So don't do this. *Never* give a number first.

 You might answer that you're not comfortable sharing the requested information and that you'd rather want to focus on the value you might add to the company.

 If they say they need a number in order to move the process forward, they're just lying to you in order to compromise your negotiating position.

 Saying that you want to make a (big) step forward both in terms of responsibility and compensation signals that you're willing to perform (even) better than before and accomplish more, but also want proportionately better compensation.

 Illustrate that only *they* know how they value your skills, how much they pay other people at their company, what their company's needs are, and how much value you'll be adding to their company. So they should suggest a base for the negotiations.

 Explain that they might give you a number and you'll happily tell them whether this is in your accepted range or not.

 Say that you *trust* them to give you a fair offer that is consistent with their standard practices and general compensation in the industry.

 Continue to block requests for a specific number or range, even if they keep pressing you on that number.

 Prior to the negotiation, you should have thought about your minimum acceptable salary. Now, do *not* accept any offer below that number.

 After receiving your first offer from the company, *no matter what number it is*, you're going to negotiate upwards. It's unlikely they have just given you their absolute maximum initially. You *always*, as a matter of policy, negotiate *all* offers.

 Negotiate all the single components of the compensation (e.g. also the vacation days) to get the best possible outcome.

 If they decline to negotiate a single component, you might ask where they suggest there is any flexibility, given that there doesn't seem to be any flexibility on that one component.

 As soon as you have a formal offer, ask for one or two days to think about it.

 "The most important process underlying strokes of creative genius is cognitive disinhibition — the tendency to pay attention to things that normally should be ignored or filtered out by attention because they appear irrelevant." (Dean Keith Simonton)

 "When Alexander Fleming noticed that a blue mold was killing off the bacteria culture in his petri dish, he could have just tossed the latter into the autoclave like any of his colleagues might have done. Instead, Fleming won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of penicillin, the antibacterial agent derived from the mold *Penicillium notatum*." (Dean Keith Simonton)

 "We have an industrial society that is based on the use of machines and technology, which serve to economize on labor. It would be logical that we should have to work less because we can have all of our needs satisfied with a minimum amount of activity. But what takes place is just the opposite. Today we work much more than ever before." (Anselm Jappe)

 "The great innovations of the past are *now* well understood as being very, very important. It's very obvious. In almost every case, they were not widely understood as such at the time. In fact, I would assert that they were often actually viewed as trivialities or jokes. I don't think it is a new phenomenon to be this dismissive about new technology." (Marc Andreessen)

 "When Thomas Edison was first working on the telephone, the assumption of the use case was the idea that telegraph operators needed to be able to talk to each other. It was considered so implausible that you would have a system that would let any ordinary person pick up the telephone and talk to another person, like that was clearly implausible, that was clearly not going to happen." (Marc Andreessen)

 "It's hard to remember, but the Internet was laughed at. It was heaped with scorn from 1993 to 1997/1998. In fact, those of you who were in the industry at that time will remember that the New York Times had a reporter on staff named Peter Lewis. I'm convinced he was hired by the editors to just write negative stories about the Internet. It was all he did. And it was always 'the Internet is never going to be a consumer medium, the Internet is not nearly as big as these people think, nobody is ever going to trust the Internet for e-commerce." (Marc Andreessen)

 "The car was absolutely viewed as a triviality and a toy when it first emerged. In fact, J.P. Morgan himself refused to invest in Ford Motor Company, with the response that it's 'just a toy for rich people', which is in fact what it was at the time. If you had one of the first cars, you had to be a rich person, which means you also had to have a driver, unless you were a very advanced rich person. You also had to have a stoker with the early cars to keep the engine going, and then you also had to travel with a full-time mechanic cause the thing would break down every three miles. So there were a lot of reasons to doubt the importance of the car." (Marc Andreessen)

 "We have a large computer rust belt, which nobody likes to talk about, but it is companies like Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Oracle, IBM, where I think the pattern will be to become commodities, no longer innovate, corresspondingly cut their labor force, and cut their profits in the decade ahead." (Peter Thiel)

 "Twitter is instant public global messaging for free. If you think about the impact of that, if you go back into any previous era, the era of telegraphs, the era of telephones, the era of television, and you tell that instead of having the communication technologies you have at the time, I can give you instant public global messaging for free, they would have thought you delivered it straight from heaven, like its the most astonishing communications breakthrough they could have possibly imagined. And we actually have it, and it actually works." (Marc Andreessen)

 The technology-driven economy greatly favors a small group of successful individuals by amplifying their talent and luck, and dramatically increasing their rewards. (Erik Brynjolfsson)

 "Agatha Christie never imagined being rich enough to own a car or poor enough to have no servants. Profound example of tech and social change." (Benedict Evans)

 "Education is the most powerful thing you can do to affect lifetime earnings." (David Autor)

 Once you've produced a certain product, the cost of making additional copies (marginal cost) tends to zero.

 Advertising allows you to give away your complete product to consumers for free while generating revenue from third parties who purchase ads that are shown to the audience. This has always been a popular business model for radio, TV and the web.

 Tiered pricing allows you to give away some products for free and conversely set higher prices for other parts of the portfolio. Examples for this model include coupons and the freemium model.

 When you bundle products that each individually have almost zero marginal cost, you can sell the whole package as a unit that's worth paying for. For example, movie streaming sites such as Netflix package individual films and series (with very low marginal costs) into a subscription that's worth paying for.

 Larger companies can make single products free to support their overall ecosystem. For example, Google and Apple subsidize their ecosystems with free GPS tools such as maps and navigation.

 Net neutrality prevents "a transformation from a market where innovation rules to one where deal-making rules. Or, a market where firms rush to make exclusive agreements with AT&T and Verizon instead of trying to improve their products." (Tim Wu)

 Regarding net neutrality, "let's think about the nation's highways. How would you feel if [they] announced an exclusive deal with General Motors to provide a special 'rush-hour' lane for GM cars only? That seems intuitively wrong. [...] And if highways really did choose favorite brands, you might buy a Pontiac instead of a Toyota to get the rush-hour lane, not because the Pontiac is actually a good car. As a result, the nature of competition among car-makers would change. Rather than try to make the best product, they would battle to make deals with highways." (Tim Wu)

 "[T]he 700-person start-up Airbnb, which allows users to rent their apartments like hotel rooms, was valued at $10 billion this past spring, about half as much as the Hilton corporation, which employs 152,000 people." (Michael Harris)

 "We are deeply concerned [...] of the very large number of dropouts by schoolchildren. This is a very disturbing situation, because the youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Try as much as possible to remain in school, because education is the most powerful weapon which we can use." (Nelson Mandela)

 Don't try to have your children occupied at any time. Boredom is an important source of creativity.

 Teach self control and discipline in as many positive ways as possible.

 Don't try to remove any bit of struggle in your children's life. They need it to grow. When all their toys are always within their reach, why should they start to crawl?

 "[Parents and teachers] often praise the ability, the talent, or the intelligence too much. The opposite of this is the good process praise. This is praise for the process the child engages in — their hard work, trying many strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their use of errors to learn, their improvement. [...] The more [you give] process praise, the more [do] kids ha[ve] a growth mindset and a desire for challenge [...]." (Carol Dweck)

 While earlier (nickel-based) batteries improved from full draining, newer (lithium-ion based) batteries suffer from that.

 Never let your lithium-ion fully drain. Try to have the battery level above 20% at any time, if possible.

 In the past, an Ethernet crossover cable (twisted pairs) was necessary in order to connect computing devices (of the same type) directly. Today, Auto MDI-X detects the required connection type via autonegotiation.

 Modern (photo)copiers (i.e. digital copiers) have hard disks. In order to copy documents, they scan them first, save them on the hard disk and then print them. In most cases, the copy on the hard disk is either permanent or can be easily recovered later.

 When using a digital camera to take a photo of a digital screen (e.g. TV, computer), you'll usually see a moiré pattern. This unwanted effect is caused by interactions between the pixel grids of the screen and the camera sensors.

 Energy density in modern batteries increases by about five percent per year through incremental improvements from R&D.

 The expression 'more than Moore' refers to the integration of more than just transistors on a chip. One is putting other components on the chips, e.g. analogue components and radio circuits, eclipsing in a system-on-a-chip (SoC).

 Changing a monitor's resolution from its "native" resolution to something else was fine with CRTs, but cannot reasonably be done with LCDs, where it would result in bad picure quality due to their fixed rasters.

 UHD (or 4K) is only worth it if you have a *very* large TV screen (larger than most people would be comfortable with in their room), if you sit very close (which you usually do in a presentation room but not at home). Obviously, all components (video source, connections and TV screen) must support UHD.

 At a distance of 10 cm, the maximum resolution that the human eye can perceive is between 876 dpi/ppi (normal visual acuity) and 2190 dpi/ppi (perfect visual acuity). Thus at the average reading distance of 30 cm, it's only 292 dpi/ppi (normal visual acuity) or 730 dpi/ppi (perfect visual acuity). So printing magazines at 300 dpi is good enough for most people. For computer monitors or TVs at home, divide 88 dpi/ppi (normal visual acuity) or 219 dpi/ppi (perfect visual acuity) by the distance in meters to get the maximum resolution you may actually perceive. Thus, in order to take the most of Full HD on a 50" screen, you'll need to sit 2 m away. For 4K resolution, you must move closer to 1 m or get a 100" screen instead.

 When including links in emails (or other texts), wrap them in angle brackets (`<...>`). This emphasizes where the link starts/ends, and it avoids problems with line wraps and trailing equals signs (`=`) in various client applications.

 You don't need to use antibacterial soap at home. Normal soap is just as effective as antibacterial one (almost) and has no disadvantages.

 Your vision does not worsen if you wear (incorrectly adjusted) glasses, but wrong glasses can cause headaches and visual fatigue.

 Your vision does not worsen if you read with too little light, for example. But bad habits can cause headaches and visual fatigue.

 Underarm hair does not cause you to sweat more, but it provides the bacteria with a bigger target, possibly resulting in stronger odor.

 It's not fresh sweat that smells, but older sweat where the bacteria start to cause more and more odor.

 If you have shingles (herpes zoster), see a doctor within 48-72 hours, who will usually give you aciclovir (and paracetamol).

 "Sensations (information delivered by organs like our eyes) can be distinct from perceptions (ideas about sensations formed by our brains)." (Jim Davies)

 "Just as blind people do not sense the color black, we do not sense anything at all in place of our lack of sensations for magnetic fields [unlike geese/birds] or ultraviolet light. [...] When you look at the scene in front of you, it has a boundary. Your visual field extends to each side only so far. If you spread your arms, and draw your hands back until they are no longer visible, [...] [t]his space does not look black. It does not look white. It just isn't." (Jim Davies)

 Exercising makes you emotionally resilient and reduces your risk of getting depression. This is due to raised levels of PGC-1alpha1, producing a substance that breaks down kynurenine.

 There are two ways you can improve your endurance performance: Increasing your oxygen supply (VO2 max) or lowering the oxygen demand by your muscles (running economy). Supply more and demand less.

 "Any patient in a hospital, when we take their clothes away and lay them in a bed, starts to lose identity; after a few days, they all start to merge into a single passive body, distinguishable ... only by the illnesses that brought them there." (Terrence Holt)

 Drinking lots of coffee on a regular basis won't enhance your mental performance. Part of the problem with caffeine is we quickly develop dependency. "Regular caffeine consumers who'd been without caffeine overnight, [are] slower on [a] reaction time task, [are] sleepier and [are] less mentally alert than non-users." They [...] improve after they [get] a caffeine drink, but only up to the level the non-users [achieve] without caffeine. (Peter Rogers)

 "With [so many] office workers in cubicles or open work spaces, it's [...] important to create one's own cocoon of sound. That brings us to a psychological answer: There is evidence that music relaxes our muscles, improves our mood, and can even moderately reduce blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety. What music steals in acute concentration, it returns to us in the form of good vibes." (Derek Thompson)

 "Seating people with their backs to a high-traffic area leads to a constant sense of unease and vulnerability." (Matt Blodgett)

 If you listen to music with earbuds or headphones at levels that block out normal discourse, you are in effect dealing lethal blows to the hair cells in your ears. (Dr. Michael D. Seidman)

 "Drowning doesn't look like drowning" (Mario Vittone): "Except in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help. The respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled, before speech occurs. [...] Drowning people cannot wave for help. Nature instinctively forces them to extend their arms laterally and press down on the water’s surface. Pressing down on the surface of the water, permits drowning people to leverage their bodies so they can lift their mouths out of the water to breathe. [...] From beginning to end of the Instinctive Drowning Response people’s bodies remain upright in the water, with no evidence of a supporting kick. Unless rescued by a trained lifeguard, these drowning people can only struggle on the surface of the water from 20 to 60 seconds before submersion occurs." (On Scene Magazine - Fall 2006) Drowning people "[a]ppear to be climbing an invisible ladder" (Mario Vittone).

 Hairs around the belly button steal tiny fibres from clothes and deposit them into the navel where they accumulate as "navel fluff". Shaving belly hair prevents the accumulation of that lint.

 “Most adults function best after seven to nine hours of sleep a night. [...] When we get fewer than seven hours, we’re impaired (to degrees that vary from person to person). When sleep persistently falls below six hours per 24, we are at an increased risk of health problems.” (James Hamblin)

 “[W]hen animals are sleep-deprived constantly, they will suffer serious biological consequences. Death is one of those consequences.” (David Dinges)

 “[R]esearchers kept people just slightly sleep deprived – allowing them only six hours to sleep each night – and watched the subjects’ performance on cognitive tests plummet. The crucial finding was that throughout their time in the study, the sixers thought they were functioning perfectly well.” (James Hamblin)

 “Thanks to caffeine, many of us stimulate [a] fight-or-flight response not just occasionally, under dire circumstances, but daily, in our offices.” (James Hamblin)

 "The familiar Ancient Greek and Roman statues were not the grey, stone figures we know today. They were actually painted in bright colours and inlaid with jewels." (James Robertson)

 "Egyptian pyramids have [not] remained the way they were at the time of their construction. Actually, their outside was made of white limestone, which concealed the layer of bricks underneath." (Saarthak Jajoria)

 The Anglicised name prefixes "Mc" and "Mac" mean "son (of)" while the prefix "O'" means "descendant (of)" or "grandson (of)".

 In order to prevent mold formation in your dishwasher, it's sufficient to run the dishwasher on a temperature of 60°C or more twice a month. This does also eliminate grease and fat residues.

 Copyright protects the expression of an idea, not the idea itself. The idea itself may be protected through patents.

 "The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying." (John Carmack)

 "If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all." (Noam Chomsky)

 "[Copyright] [r]egistration does offer some significant benefits [...]. But it is not required in order for you to mark your proprietary works of authorship with the appropriate notice. [Even] [t]he notice is not required in order to have protection. However, the notice [...] puts others on notice that you claim protection [of] a particular work. Once a party is on notice of your claim, they can be liable for wilful infringement and treble damages. Copyright in the US and most of the world is automatic upon fixation of an original work of authorship in a tangible medium of expression." (Robert B. Dellenbach)

 The case Oracle v. Google has been about copyright and patent claims, where Oracle argues that Google infringed by copying the Java API. In May 2012, a United States District Court decided that Google did not infringe. Judge William Haskell Alsup started learning Java solely for the purpose of getting a better understanding of the case. The Circuit Court then, however, reversed the decision in May 2014, finding that Google *did* infringe on Oracle's Java API. In October 2014, Google then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the copyright fight.

 Surround yourself with smart and inspiring people, and if you're the smartest person in the room, maybe it's time to move on.

 Don't promise when you're happy. Don't reply when you're angry. Don't decide when you're sad.

 Nothing is worth more than your personal health. Live a healthy lifestyle, and go to annual check-ups if possible.

 Get enough sleep every night. Sleep is really important to so many facets in life, be it regeneration, attentiveness or physical health.

 Getting up 15-30 minutes earlier every morning is not that much, but the effect on your available time in the morning is great!

 Don't waste any time on jealousy.

 What other people think about you is none of your business.

 Don't be afraid to ask someone if you're not sure, no matter what topic, what time or place.

 Finish one project before you start another.

 Smile often, even to complete strangers.

 Apologize when you should.

 Be curious. This is certainly more important than just being intelligent.

 Either at work or in your freetime, do something that makes you proud.

 "I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying." (Michael Jordan)

 Make peace with your past so it won't disturb your present.

 Don't compare your life to others'.

 Don't text with your mobile phone when you're drunk.

 Success is like being pregnant, everybody congratulates you, but nobody knows how many times you have been fucked.

 "Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up." (Thomas Edison)

 "I am a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it." (Thomas Jefferson)

 When you are teaching or explaining something, never say "just do" or "it's easy". It's confusing and alienating to new learners.

 "Opportunists have always been held in disrepute -- especially by those who had the same opportunities and didn't take them." (Rhett Butler)

 "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." (Laozi)

 "Determination is really two separate things: resilience and drive. Resilience keeps you from being pushed backwards. Drive moves you forwards." (Jessica Livingston)

 "[W]e see our future selves as strangers. Though we will inevitably share their fates, the people we will become in a decade, quarter century, or more, are unknown to us. This impedes our ability to make good choices on their — which of course is our own—behalf. [...] We might choose to procrastinate, and let some other version of our self deal with problems or chores. Or, as in the case of [a] smoking boy, we can focus on that version of our self that derives pleasure, and ignore the one that pays the price." (Alisa Opar)

 "Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. [...] I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death." (Nelson Mandela)

 "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it." (Nelson Mandela)

 "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." (Nelson Mandela)

 "There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered." (Nelson Mandela)

 "The first step isn't as hard as we make it out to be. ['Just do it']. Stop over-thinking it." (Jon Bell)

 McDonald's Theory: "[W]hen we're trying to decide where to eat for lunch and no one has any ideas, I recommend McDonald's. An interesting thing happens. Everyone unanimously agrees that we can't possibly go to McDonald's, and better lunch suggestions emerge. [...] It's as if we've broken the ice with the worst possible idea. [...] [P]eople are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones. [...] The second step is easier than the first." (Jon Bell)

 "Have the argument clear in your mind; the words will follow naturally." (Cato the Elder)

 "We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick." (Tim Cook)

 "Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did." (Newt Gingrich)

 "Perseverance is failing 19 times and succeeding the 20th." (Julie Andrews)

 "No one succeeds without effort ... Those who succeed owe their success to perseverance." (Ramana Maharshi)

 "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)

 Learn to distrust your negative emotions. Later, they usually seem overstated or unfounded. (Giovanni Tirloni)

 "You work in the sales department of your own career. Sell your ability to solve problems." (duggan)

 "Don't spend your precious time asking 'Why isn't the world a better place?'. It will only be time wasted. The question to ask is 'How can I make it better?' To that there is an answer." (Leo Buscaglia)

 "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened." (Theodor "Dr. Seuss" Seuss Geisel)

 "The greater part of human activity is designed to make permanent those experiences and joys which are only lovable because they are changing." (Alan Watts)

 "The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance." (Alan Watts)

 "A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts. So he loses touch with reality, and lives in a world of illusion." (Alan Watts)

 "Existence, [Alan Watts] says, is fundamentally *playful*. It's less like a journey, and more like a piece of music or a dance. And the point of dancing isn't to arrive at a particular spot on the floor; the point of dancing is simply to dance." (Kevin Simler)

 "I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics ... then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do." (Steve Jobs)

 "Before cofounding GitHub I applied for an engineering job at Yahoo and didn't get it. Don't let other people discourage you." (Chris Wanstrath)

 Survivorship bias, a type of selection bias, is the error of concentrating on subjects that "survived" some process or selection and thereby overlooking all the others due to their lack of visibility.

 If you believe that music in the past was better than today's music, it may be because only the most popular music from one generation "survives" and, in a form of survivorship bias, distorts the comparability for you.

 In the area of highly competitive careers (e.g. with singers, movie stars and athletes), one does generally overlook the myriad of people that may have been similarly skilled and determined as the victorious ones, but who did ultimately fail because they were not as lucky. This causes a survivorship bias.

 "Once you've accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you." (George R. R. Martin)

 "A bruise is a lesson ... and each lesson makes us better." (George R. R. Martin)

 "We shouldn't be looking for heroes, we should be looking for good ideas." (Noam Chomsky)

 "[As an astronaut, you] develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, 'Look at that, you son of a bitch'." (Edgar D. Mitchell)

 "Adulthood is emailing 'sorry for the delayed response!' back and forth until one of you dies." (Marissa Miller)

 "Inherit (or luck into) a large fortune, and give a couple million to a good cause -- never mind that it will affect your quality of life not at all -- and you'll be lionized as a hero. The great and the good will invite you onto their podiums -- but a poor person who takes in a foster kid gets virtually no recognition, even if fostering involves real sacrifice on their part." (Cory Doctorow)

 "Don't forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor." (John Dickinson ("1776"))

 "Meritocracy is a tautology, of course. There's no objective measure of *merit* so there's no way to know whether your society is meritocratic or not. Every famous, powerful, rich person owes their status to a combination of skill, luck, and persistence. The best luck of all is to be born to fortunate circumstances, well fed and well educated and well loved. We know for a fact that billions lack some or all of these forms of luck, and among those people are innumerable potential Stephen Hawkings and Steve Jobses and Albert Einsteins. The fact that Jobs was born to a Syrian refugee and that Hawking struggles with a debilitating illness just shows you how fickle luck is -- unless you believe that evolution produced exactly one brilliant tech entrepreneur in the ranks of Syrian refugees and one brilliant scientist with ALS, then you have to believe that the others just didn't get quite so lucky." (Cory Doctorow)

 The "Rule of 72" allows you to estimate the effect of growth rates: Divide `72` by the growth rate as an integer (i.e. the actual rate multiplied by `100`) and you'll get the number of years it takes the base quantity to double.

 It's easy to complain, blame, resent, judge and take. It's hard to inspire, teach, trust, love and believe. Do the hard work. (Vala Afshar)

 "Service is supposed to be about making the world a better place or helping people who are less fortunate, but [when] it's done for the resume, it really just becomes about yourself." (William Deresiewicz)

 "The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten." (Unknown)

 If you can't pay cash, you can't afford it.

 "[W]ages and income are about what the job is worth, not the individual. [...] Your income potential isn't about what you need or what the employer can afford; it's about the value of what you do." (Ron Rule)

 The world's most famous photo is (arguably) "Guerrillero Heroico" by Alberto Korda from 1960, showing the then 31-year-old revolutionary Che Guevara. The photographer did not receive (or claim) any payments for his picture, which also helped the photo become so popular.

 "A showrunner's duties often combine those traditionally assigned to the writer, executive producer and script editor. Unlike films, where directors are in creative control of a production, in episodic television, the showrunner outranks the director." (Wikipedia, various authors)

 While Spotify doesn't pay owners of recordings, publishers, songwriters and artists *per stream*, an effective "per stream" average can be calculated. It's between 5.00 USD and 8.00 USD per 1,000 streams.

 "Rihanna is often described as a 'manufactured' pop star, because she doesn't write her songs, but neither did Sinatra or Elvis. She embodies a song in the way an actor inhabits a role -- and no one expects the actor to write the script." (John Seabrook)

 Depending on the type of ads shown (e.g. pre-roll or banner ads), whether ads are paid for on a per-click (CPC) or per-view (CPM) basis, and depending on the audience (e.g. demographics and geographical origin), YouTube videos can, on average, generate between 0.80 USD and 5.00 USD of revenue per 1,000 views for users.

 "The contention of Frantz Fanon, the 20th century revolutionary, [was] that 'the aim of terrorism is to terrify'. How do the media help do that? By hyping the threat from terrorism." (David R. Henderson)

 "The current system of ad-supported news leads to clickbait and sensationalism. We need to pay for good journalism." (Andrew Ng)

 "A critical, independent and investigative press is the lifeblood of any democracy. The press must be free from state interference. It must have the economic strength to stand up to the blandishments of government officials. It must have sufficient independence from vested interests to be bold and inquiring without fear or favour. It must enjoy the protection of the constitution, so that it can protect our rights as citizens." (Nelson Mandela)

 "'Socialism' is no more an evil word than 'Christianity'. Socialism no more prescribed Joseph Stalin and his secret police and shuttered churches than Christianity prescribed the Spanish Inquisition. Christianity and socialism alike, in fact, prescribe a society dedicated to the proposition that all men, women, and children are created equal and shall not starve." (Kurt Vonnegut)

 "The story of *meritocracy* -- a society that migrates wealth, status, and decision-making power into the hands of the most capable -- is seductive. Rich people love the idea of meritocracy, because the alternative is that their lion's share is unfair, the product of luck, or, worse, cheating. But many of meritocracy's losers love it, too. In the [disputed] words of John Steinbeck, 'Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.'" (Cory Doctorow)

 "[Some] states are on the verge of reversing decades-old laws about homosexual relationships and marijuana use. If the old laws could have been perfectly enforced through surveillance, society would never have reached the point where the majority of citizens thought those things were okay. There has to be a period where they are still illegal yet increasingly tolerated, so that people can look around and say, 'You know, that wasn't so bad.' Yes, the process takes decades, but it's a process that can't happen without lawbreaking. [...] The perfect enforcement that comes with ubiquitous government surveillance chills this process. We need imperfect security -- systems that free people to try new things [...]. Freedoms we now take for granted were often at one time viewed as threatening or even criminal by the past power structure. Those changes might never have happened if the authorities had been able to achieve social control through surveillance. This is one of the main reasons all of us should care about [...] surveillance, even if we are not personally chilled by its existence. We suffer the effects because people around us will be less likely to proclaim new political or social ideas, or act out of the ordinary. If J. Edgar Hoover's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr. had been successful in silencing him, it would have affected far more people than King and his family." (Bruce Schneier)

 "What is [...] damaging -- and [...] engaging, and thus lucrative for Facebook -- is all of us in our own virtual neighborhoods of our own making, liking opinions that tell us we're right instead of engaging with viewpoints that make us question our assumptions." (Ben Thompson)

 "As Cass Sunstein and others have shown, people become more extreme when they're around others who share their beliefs. [...] [T]he internet makes it easy to settle in a virtual neighborhood with people who agree with you. Polarization is going to get a lot worse before it starts getting better." (Ezra Klein)

 "No woman in a burqa (or a hijab or a burkini) has ever done me any harm. But I was sacked (without explanation) by a man in a suit. Men in suits missold me pensions and endowments, costing me thousands of pounds. A man in a suit led us on a disastrous and illegal war. Men in suits led the banks and crashed the world economy. Other men in suits then increased the misery to millions through austerity. If we are to start telling people what to wear, maybe we should ban suits." (Henry Stewart)

 "No country is immune from terrorism. It's easy to terrorize. Government and law enforcement have to be correct 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year." (John Kerry)

 "Throughout history, reliance on terrorism has been the tactic of movements that were weak and had little popular support. The goal of terrorist attacks is always to provoke an overreaction that will increase support for the terrorist's cause." (Greg G.)

 "Disillusionment and cynicism have become natural byproducts of everyday journalism. [...] As a result, what audiences see beyond their direct experience is a world of unchecked pathology, and it makes it all too easy to fear and demonize others. It shapes people's behaviors and choice of leaders." (David Bornstein and Tina Rosenberg)

 "Since the early 1970s, surveys conducted annually have revealed that trust and confidence in virtually all American institutions -- government, corporations, banks, medicine, education, organized religion and, yes, the press -- have been declining steadily." (David Bornstein and Tina Rosenberg)

 "[M]any Americans today have difficulty imagining, valuing or even believing in the promise of incremental system change, which leads to a greater appetite for revolutionary, smash-the-machine change [...]." (David Bornstein and Tina Rosenberg)

 "The best defense against the fear-mongering of the demagogue is to reveal the decency, competence and courage of people determined to fix their society." (David Bornstein and Tina Rosenberg)

 "If I can read your newspaper from orbit, what is public? If I can tell where you are in your house by imaging through the wall, what is public?" (Dan Geer)

 The digital age and the internet take away the natural right to be forgotten. You are no longer able to fully reinvent yourself.

 "Since 1851, Amsterdam had a registry that recorded the following innocent pieces of data about the residents: name, date of birth, address, marital status, parents, profession, religion, previous addresses and date of death if deceased. [...] What we do know is that [a] little field caused untold thousands of people to die once the occupiers decided to use it to locate Jewish people." (Jacques Mattheij)

 "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say." (Edward Snowden)

 Mass surveillance can be used against journalists, whistleblowers and human rights activists. So even if you think that 'if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear', people who represent your political beliefs *may* have something to fear.

 "Show me the man, and I will find you the crime." (Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria)

 Privacy-preserving contact discovery remains an unsolved problem in practice. You can't hash contact identifiers before transmitting them because the space of pre-hash identifiers is usually too small, especially for phone numbers. Furthermore, you can't salt the identifiers. One might use bloom filters but this does not work for large lists of possible contacts. (Moxie Marlinspike)

 "The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel." (Steven Furtick)

 "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." (Upton Beall Sinclair)

 "[H]appiness [is] the most attractive female emotion expression, and one of the least attractive in males. In contrast, pride show[s] the reverse pattern; it [is] the most attractive male expression, and one of the least attractive in women." (Jessica L. Tracy and Alec T. Beall)

 "Because it is always possible, after the fact, to come up with a story about why things worked out the way they did -- that the first 'Harry Potter' really was a brilliant book, even if the eight publishers who rejected it didn't know that at the time -- our belief in determinism is rarely shaken, no matter how often we are surprised." (Duncan J. Watts)

 "[W]hen people tend to like what other people like, differences in popularity are subject to what is called 'cumulative advantage', or the 'rich get richer' effect. This means that if one object happens to be slightly more popular than another at just the right point, it will tend to become more popular still." (Duncan J. Watts)

 "All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda system, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and to consume." (Noam Chomsky)

 "We all know that knowledge workers work best by getting into 'flow', also known as being 'in the zone', where they are fully concentrated on their work and fully tuned out of their environment. They lose track of time and produce great stuff through absolute concentration. This is when they get all of their productive work done. Writers, programmers, scientists, and even basketball players will tell you about being in the zone." (Joel Spolsky)

 "It's when we have no firsthand information and must rely on the news that the world gets scary." (David Bornstein and Tina Rosenberg)

 "We know from psychological research that a steady diet of news about violence, corruption and incompetence leads to increased fear, learned helplessness, hopelessness, cynicism, depression, isolation, hostility, contempt and anxiety. The journalist Walter Lippmann wrote: 'The way in which the world is imagined determines at any particular moment what men will do.'" (David Bornstein and Tina Rosenberg)

 "Instead of studying, a student goes to a movie the night before an exam. If he performs poorly, he can attribute his failure to a lack of studying rather than to a lack of ability or intelligence. On the other hand, if he does well on the exam, he may conclude that he has exceptional ability, because he was able to perform well without studying." (Edward Hirt)

 "The kids who race ahead in the readers without much supervision get praised for being smart. What are they learning? They're learning that being smart is not about overcoming tough challenges. It's about *finding work easy*. When they get to college or graduate school and it starts being hard, they don't necessarily know how to deal with that." (Carol Dweck)

 "[A] science survey class [...] consists almost entirely of the theories that turned out to be right -- not the folks who believed in the mythical 'N-rays', declared that human beings had forty-eight chromosomes, or saw imaginary canals on Mars. [...] The people who believed in them frequently come across as ludicrous yokels, even though many of them were distinguished scientists who made real contributions to their fields." (Megan McArdle)

 The most important lesson kids should learn is "the ability to learn from their mistakes, to be knocked down and to pick themselves up -- the ability, in other words, to fail gracefully." (Megan McArdle)

 "I think about ninety percent of the problem in teaching, or maybe ninety-eight percent, is just to help the students get interested." (Noam Chomsky)

 "Work finally begins when the fear of doing nothing exceeds the fear of doing it badly." (Alain de Botton)

 "If your job is to eat a frog, eat it first thing in the morning, and if your job is to eat two frogs, eat the big one first." (Mark Twain)

 "No one 'builds a house'. They lay one brick again and again and the end result is a house. Procrastinators are great visionaries -- they love to fantasize about the beautiful mansion they will one day have built -- but what they need to be are gritty construction workers, who methodically lay one brick after the other, day after day, without giving up, until a house is built." (Tim Urban)

 "But the best thing [to fight procrastination] is to recognize that you don't have to be in the mood to do a certain task -- just ignore how you feel and get started." (Ana Swanson)

 Milgram experiment
   One of the most famous social science experiments of all time
   Showed that most people will obey an authority figure even if the authority gives orders that conflict with the subject's morals.
   Milgram wanted to prove that Germans have a stronger willingness to obey to authorities. Being the child of two eastern-European Jews, survivor's guilt after the Holocaust was probably one part of Milgram's motivation.
   Milgram's work followed the Asch conformity experiments (where participants make judgments about drawn lines) but Milgram wanted to turn it "into a more humanly significant experiment".
   The subjects were ordered to to give allegedly painful electric shocks to other people, who were in fact actors.
   First tried on Americans in New Haven, the experiment showed subjects to be far more obedient than expected, so Milgram knew the German comparison wouldn't matter anymore.

 Always use the rear hobs of your cooker and make the handles of your pots point to the rear as well if you have small children.

 Never put out a grease fire by quenching it with water. Instead, extinguish it by choking it, i.e. cover it with a lid or blanket.

 When serving warm dishes or beverages to small children, always check the temperature again by tasting the food.

 Never leave the control for water temperature at 'hot'. The next person using the water may scald or burn themself.

 Secure your water faucets with a thermostat that limits the maximum temperature to 50°C.

 On New Year's Eve, never reignite unexploded fireworks but leave them untouched or render them harmless with water.

 Never keep firecrackers in your (trouser) pockets. They may ignite due to the friction and cause serious burns.

 Never use liquid fire accelerants such as ethanol. These evaporate heavily and cause highly explosive vapor. Instead, use solid barbecue lighters, e.g. cubes.

 After the barbecue, let the fire and the glowing embers extinguish and cool down completely. During that period, don't leave the barbecue device unattended.

 If you expect that you might need to extinguish a fire, have a bucket of sand or a fire blanket readily available.

 For burns, the most important emergency aid is cooling down the burnt places with water (about 15°C) for 10 to 15 minutes.

 "You have as much computing power in an Apple iPhone as was available at the time of the Apollo missions. But what is it being used for? It's being used to throw angry birds at pigs; it's being used to send pictures of your cat to people halfway around the world; it's being used to check in as the virtual mayor of a virtual nowhere while you're riding a subway from the nineteenth century." (Peter Thiel)

 "Nixon's 1974 call for full energy independence by 1980 has given way to Obama's 2011 call for one-third oil independence by 2020." (Peter Thiel)

 "The Golden Gate Bridge was built in three-and-a-half years in the 1930s. It's taken seven years to build an access road that costs more than the original bridge in real dollars." (Peter Thiel)

 Deep water does not freeze as easily because (a) it takes colder temperatures to freeze water under pressure (b) existing ice will always float at the top and prevent exchange (c) there's geothermal energy from the ocean bed.

 "Computing devices have been consistently multiplying in power [...] from the mechanical calculating devices used in the 1890 U.S. census, to Turing's relay-based machine that cracked the Nazi enigma code, to the vacuum tube computer that predicted Eisenhower's win in 1952, to the transistor-based machines used in the first space launches, to the integrated-circuit-based personal computer." (Ray Kurzweil)

 "Moore's law" is the observation and forecast (and not a physical or natural law) by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore from 1965, revised in 1975, noticing that over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.

 "[C]himps and bonobos in particular take pride of place as our nearest living relatives, sharing approximately 99 percent of our DNA, with gorillas trailing at 98 percent. Yet that tiny portion of unshared DNA makes a world of difference: it gives us, for instance, our bipedal stance and the ability to plan missions to Mars." (Kate Wong)

 There are five Nobel Prizes that had been established by Alfred Nobel in his will. Four of those are awarded by Swedish bodies while the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by a 5-person committee from Norway.

 Radar (*radio* detection and ranging), Lidar (*light* detection and ranging) and Sonar (*sound* navigation and ranging) are systems for object detection and similar purposes.

 The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of periodic data (e.g. radio waves) that you see when an observer and a source move relatively to each other. You can witness it when an ambulance with a siren approaches (higher frequency), passes (normal frequency), and then departs again (lower frequency).

 Making use of the Doppler effect, you can measure the speed of a target with Radar, Lidar and Sonar.

 "The difference between weather and climate is a measure of time. Weather is what conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time, and climate is how the atmosphere 'behaves' over relatively long periods of time. [...] Some scientists define climate as the average weather for a particular region and time period, usually taken over 30 years." (NASA)

 The best place to see the Hollywood sign is near Lake Hollywood Park, i.e. 3204 Canyon Lake Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90068. You can even get to the place above the sign with a great view. It's a three hour round-trip hike from Bronson Canyon where there's plenty of parking. (Alissa Walker)

 `fork()` is a system call that is used for process creation. The calling process first creates a copy of itself (i.e. the child process) which may be followed by a call to `exec()`.

 `fork()` may fail and returns `-1` in that case.

 When calling `kill()`, first check if your `pid` is valid. If you treat `-1` as a valid `pid`, you're going to kill *all* processes "for which the calling process has permission to send signals, except for process 1 (init)".

 If you see the error message `/bin/sh^M: bad interpreter`, your file has DOS line endings (CRLF) and must thus be converted to Unix line endings (LF) first.

 "Show, don't tell": This enables the reader to experience the story implicitly through actions and feelings, and not explicitly through the author's summarizations. The goal is not to drown the reader in heavy-handed adjectives, but rather to allow readers to interpret significant details themselves.

 Telling may be used as a shortcut, since showing requires more words. Telling may cover a greater span of time more concisely.

 "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or scene. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted." (James Scott Bell)

 "The warning against telling leads to a confusion that causes novice writers to think that everything should be acted out ... when in fact the responsibility of showing should be assumed by the energetic and specific use of language." (Francine Prose)
